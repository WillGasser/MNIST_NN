# Will Gasser | 2/20/2025 | MNIST NN

This is a simple NN with back propogation to formalize my understanding of ML and NN concepts.

I am limiting myself to having imports: numpy, random, time (just for stats), pandas (just for data read), and matplotlib for plotting 

Let us see how fast I can complete this, oh and no LLMs for any functions, I will note if I use it for syntax.

I used LLMS for math notation and used many videos for helping explain the chain rule. 
Lots of time went into figuring this out I am so ready to go back to using libraries
